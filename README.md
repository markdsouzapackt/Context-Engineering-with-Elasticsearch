# Context Engineering with Elasticsearch

This repository contains the source code of the book [Context Engineering with Elasticsearch]() by [Enrico Zimuel](https://www.zimuel.it).


## Install the project examples

To install the Python examples, you can create and activate a virtual
environment ([venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)).

Use the following commands from the root folder of the repository:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

After, you can install all the required packages as follows:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In order to execute the examples, you need to configure the `.env` file.
You can generate this file copying the `.env.dev` template file, as follows:

```bash
cp .env.dev .env
```

And then you can edit the `.env` file with your settings about Elasticsearch and OpenAI (some of the examples require an API key).

## Execute the Python examples

You can execute the python examples from the command line, as follows:

```bash
python -m chapter1.token
```

This will execute the Python script [chapter1/token.py](chapter1/token.py).

## Install Elasticsearch

To execute the examples reported in this repository you need to have an
instance of [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch) running. You can register for a free trial on
[Elastic Cloud](https://www.elastic.co/cloud/cloud-trial-overview) or install a local instance of Elasticsearch on your computer.

To install locally, you need to execute this command in the terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://elastic.co/start-local | sh
```

This will install Elasticsearch and [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana) on macOS, Linux and Windows (using WSL).
